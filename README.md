###### Author: Michaen Ho

### Project Overview

For this project, we will make use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to perform sentiment analysis based on customer reviews from the Singapore Airlines. This could help provide further insights into customer satisfaction and service quality provided by the airline.

### Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/singapore-airlines-reviews). It contains 10000 anonymized customer reviews, providing a broad perspective on the passenger experience with Singapore Airlines. It has features such as review title and text, satisfaction rating and also the number of helpful votes. All personal identifiers have been removed to ensure ethical standards.
